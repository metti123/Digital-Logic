The Quine–McCluskey algorithm or the method of prime implicants is a method used for minimization  of  boolean  functions. 
The method involves two steps:
1.  Finding all prime implicants of the function. 
2.  Use  those  prime  implicants  in  a  prime  implicant  chart  to  find  the  essential  prime implicants  of  the  function,  as  well  as  other  prime  implicants  that  are  necessary  to  cover the function. 

The outcome of the code is as follows:
